## üîß Configuration

### API Integration

The application is designed to work with a backend API but includes comprehensive mock data for demonstration. To switch from mock data to a real API:

1. **Update API base URL** in `src/services/api.js`:
```javascript
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://your-api-domain.com/api', // Change from '/api'
  // ... other config
});
```

2. **Remove mock fallbacks** in API service functions by removing the `catch` blocks that use mock data.

### Expected API Endpoints

The application expects the following REST API endpoints:

```
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout
POST /api/schools/submit
GET  /api/schools/pending
GET  /api/schools
PATCH /api/schools/:id/approve
PATCH /api/schools/:id/deliver
GET  /api/students/search
GET  /api/students/verify
POST /api/students/:id/collect
GET  /api/reports
GET  /api/reports/inventory
GET  /api/reports/activity
GET  /api/reports/dashboard
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory for environment-specific configuration:

```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

## üé® Customization

### Styling
The application uses Tailwind CSS with custom colors defined in `tailwind.config.js`:
- Primary: #007BFF (Blue)
- Success: #28A745 (Green)
- Error: #DC3545 (Red)

### Fonts
Uses Google Fonts (Roboto) loaded via CDN in `public/index.html`.

### Inventory Settings
The total book inventory (300,000) and books per student (20) can be modified in:
- `src/contexts/InventoryContext.js` (total books)
- `src/mocks.js` (mock data)
- Various components that calculate book requirements

## üìä Data Management

### State Management
